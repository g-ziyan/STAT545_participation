# STAT 545A/547M: Exploratory Data Analysis
### This repo includes my class exerciese and homework assignments for the course STAT545A and 547M.
### Here you could find the usage of data analysis, data visulization, web-app development and pipeline automation in R.
This repo serves as my own personal cheat sheet for R language and I also would be happy if you find something helpful.
