# STAT 545A/547M: Exploratory Data Analysis
This repo includes my class exerciese and homework assignments for the course STAT545A and 547M.

Here you could find the usage of *data analysis, data visulization, web-app development and pipeline automation* in R.

This repo serves as my own personal cheat sheet for R language and I'm also happy if you find something helpful.
