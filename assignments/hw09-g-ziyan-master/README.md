# hw09 for g-ziyan

#### This repo is the Homework 09 for STAT547M. In this assignment, our task is to modify the make activity pipeline we made in class.

Based on `words.txt`, I further analysed the number of vowels in an English word. More specifically, I counted the times of occurence of vowels in each word in `words.txt`, and tabulated them into a csv file. Then I took that csv file as input to my Rmd, which communicates the results. I also fixed the Makefile to ensure the whole stuff are included in the existing pipeline.
